# Blackjack Card Game

## Overview
This project aims to create a blackjack card game using the common web stack, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. It's a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player competes against the dealer rather than against each other. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

## How to Play
In blackjack, the cards have specific values:
- Number cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
- Aces can be worth 1 point or 11 points, whichever is more beneficial to the player.

The game typically proceeds as follows:
1. Each player is dealt two cards face up, while the dealer gets one card face up and one card face down.
2. Players can then choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
3. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game. If not, the game proceeds until all players have either stood or busted.
4. Once all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card.
5. The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher.
6. The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, or if the dealer busts.

## Beating the House
One strategy for improving the odds of winning in blackjack is card counting. Card counting involves keeping track of the cards that have been dealt and adjusting your bets and playing strategy accordingly. By knowing which cards are more likely to be dealt next, players can gain an advantage over the house.

However, it's essential to note that card counting is not illegal, but it is frowned upon by casinos. Many casinos employ various countermeasures to prevent card counting, such as shuffling the deck more frequently or banning players suspected of counting cards.

## Learning Objectives
- **Implement Advanced Game Logic**: I am using this project to learn how to implement more complex game logic, such as handling splits, double downs, insurance bets, and other advanced blackjack features.
- **Study Statistical Concepts**: Dive deeper into statistical concepts relevant to blackjack, such as probability theory, expected value calculations, and risk assessment, to understand the underlying mathematics behind the game and potential strategies for maximizing winning chances.
- **Explore Optimization Techniques**: Explore optimization techniques to improve game performance, such as efficient data structures for card handling, minimizing DOM manipulation, and optimizing algorithms for game logic.
- **Prepare for Future Projects**: I am using this project as a stepping stone to explore more complex game development projects, delve into backend development for multiplayer functionality, or expand into other areas of web development beyond the scope of a single game.
